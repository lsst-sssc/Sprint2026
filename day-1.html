							<h3> Introduction to the LSST Solar System First Data Sprint </h3>
							
 							 <p> The Sprint is designed to be as interactive. The idea to spend some dedicated time to dive into the early Rubin/LSST data products and carve out some time to try and kickstart some activities that you can carry forward during the year. There will be some talks, discussion sessions, and project time.  On the first day of the workshop, 
								 atteendees will pitch projects. It's okay if you don't have a project idea, some people with pitch ideas looking for help. So there will be ways you can get involved during the Sprint. </p>
							
							<h3> Remote Participation and Communications </h3>
							<p> We will be streaming and recording the talks for those who cannot attend in person. We will post the recordings online as quickly as possible.</p>
				
							<h3> Code of Conduct </h3>
							<p> All attendees have agreed to and are expected to follow the meeting <a href='https://lsst-sssc.github.io/Sprint2026/code_of_conduct.html'>Code of Conduct</a>. </p>  

							 <section id="venue">
							<h3> Venue </h3>
							<p> The Sprint will be in Belfast in Nothern Ireland/UK this year. We will be hosted by the <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/astrophysics-research-centre/">Astrophysics Research Centre </a> and the <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofMathematicsandPhysics/">School of Mathematics and Physics </a> at <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/">Queen's University Belfast </a> in the Lanyon Building and the New (Main) Physics Building.</p>

							<h3> Getting Around Belfast </h3>
							<p> Belfast is a very walkable and connected by Translink buses which mostly take contactless credit payment. We recommend using google maps and <a href"https://www.translink.co.uk/">translink</a> to plan your bus rides (note the time tables don't always match, but most stops have digitial signs listing when the next bus is coming). The 7,8,9,U1/U2 buses are probably the ones you'll want to take. Details aboutn accessible bus access can you be find <a href="https://www.translink.co.uk/accessibility">here</a>.  If you're looking for a cab, <a href="https://fonacab.com/">fonacab </a> is one of the cab companies that serves the local Belfast area. Uber is also avaialble in Belfast as well.</p>

							<h3> What do you mean by project? </h3>
							<p> A project can be a wide variety of things, spanning everything from exploring the simulated LSST Solar System database, writing a paper/white paper/AAS Research note draft,  brainstorming a funding proposal idea, learning a new tool, software development, drafting an observing proposal, etc. Basically 
								anything that is going to help you get ready for Day 1 of LSST. We'll have time during Day 1 to brainstorm project ideas, and on Day 2, we'll have time for everyone who wants to lead a project to pitch their project. It's totally okay if you don't have a project idea. If you don't have a project in mind that's okay too, you can join one or more of the projects that are pitched on Day 2. The goal is to get together and spend a few dedicated days making something or learning a new skill that will help get you ready for LSST data. </p>
							</p>
						
						       <h3> What are Unconference Sessions? </h3>
						
							<p> These are dedicated timeslots without a set agenda; participants will decide what is to be discussed/presented on the day of. This could be a discussion, debate, demo,tutorial, etc. Topics will be pitched and then voted on. The top three or four topics will be assigned rooms. If you have a discussion topic you want to bring up at the consortium meeting, this is the best way to do it. </p>

							<h3> What are lightning talks?</h3>
							<p> A lightning talk is a 2-3 minute talk on whatever you want to share with Sprint attendees. It could be advertising a new software package, paper, research result. Anything you think is of interest. In the lightning session, for each talk you can post 1 slide and will be given 2-3 minutes to present the slide. You can sign up for a lightning talk through the registration form. </p>
							
							<h3> I'm new to the SSSC and/or the LSST Solar System Readiness Sprints </h3>
							<p> Day 0 will help get you help to speed. It's the optional half day before the start of the main sprint that is designed for people who are new to Rubin/LSST and the SSSC or people just looking for a refresher on the status of Rubin Observatory and the expected LSST data products.</p> 
							
						
							<h3> Is there a primer of the expected LSST/Rubin Observatory Solar System Data Products </h3>
							<p> Yes, take a look at the SSSC's <a href="http://lsst-sssc.github.io/dataProds.html">data products webpage </a>, and watch the talk below on Rubin Observatory Data Products </a> from last year's virtual Sprint. </p>
